## Youth health and wellness resources app


**Overview: An app that youth can use to find and connect with health and wellness resources specific to their needs.**

### Stories

1 | As someone who isn't sure how to look for help for <mental/physical health> issues,
I want connect with resources,
so that I can receive support <for issue>.

2 | As a someone who wants consistent help,
I want a place to save and refer back to resources,
so that I can easily stay in contact with help/support.

3 | As someone with specific needs,
I want to be able to save my preferences/needs,
so that I can connect with the appropriate resources.

4 | As a high schooler living in a rural area,
I want to find resources that offer remote help,
so that I do not need to worry about commuting.


### Acceptance Criteria

**Create a database connected to an app with search/filter functions to help people narrow down resources.**
*| Scenario 1 |*
Given the vast amount of mental health and wellness resources that exist,
an app that allows people to search for what they need within specific parameters,
would make it easier for people to find appropriate help.

**Allow users to create an account to log info and preferences and save resource information.**
*| Scenario 2 |*

**Allow those using the app to filter results based on whether or not they can connect to resources in person or remote.**
*| Scenario 3 |*
Given that some youth do not have local resources or are unable to commute,
when they find resources,
then they have the option to only find resources that fit their needs (in person/remote).
