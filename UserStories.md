## Health & Wellness Resource App 

**Overview: An app that youth can use to find and connect with health and wellness resources specific to their needs.**

### Stories

1 | As someone who isn't sure how to look for help for <mental/physical health> issues,
I want to connect with resources,
so that I can receive support <for issue>.

2 | As someone with specific needs,
I want to be able to save my preferences/needs,
so that I can connect with the appropriate resources.

3 | As someone without means of transportation,
I want to find resources that offer remote help,
so that I do not need to worry about commuting.


### Acceptance Criteria

**Create a database connected to an app with filter functions to help people narrow down resources.**
*| Scenario 1 |*
Given the vast amount of mental health and wellness resources that exist,
an app that allows people to search for what they need within specific parameters,
would make it easier for people to find appropriate help.

**Allow users to create an account to log info and preferences and save resource information.**
*| Scenario 2 |*

**Allow those using the app to filter results based on whether they can connect to resources in person or remote.**
*| Scenario 3 |*
Given that some people do not have local resources or are unable to commute,
they are able to filter by resources that are online or over the phone.
