# Youth|Matters. [Capstone]

## Health & wellness app for adolescents/young adults.

Youth|Matters is an app to help adolescents/young adults find health & wellness resources. The main purpose of the app is to help users filter through resources in order to find the ones that best fit their needs; to do so, the user can create an account to save their specifications & preferences, and the app will "recommend" resources based on what the user selects.

## User Stories

1 | As someone looking for health and wellness resources,
I want to be able to save my preferences/needs to easily filter through resources, so that I can connect with the appropriate places.

**Create a database connected to an app with filter functions to help people narrow down resources.**

*Scenario:* Given the vast amount of mental health and wellness resources that exist, an app that allows people to search for what they need within specific parameters would make it easier for people to find appropriate help.
____________

2 | As someone who has a hard time keeping track of things, I want to be able to find/access resources from one place.

**Allow users to create a secure account to log into to save and quickly access resource information.**

*Scenario:* An account feature would allow users to save their information and preferences, as well as filter out resources they don't need.
______________

3 | As someone without means of transportation,
I want to find resources that offer remote help,
so that I do not need to worry about commuting.

**Allow those using the app to filter results based on whether they can connect to resources in person or remote.**

*Scenario:* Some people do not have local resources or are unable to commute, therefore those users are able to filter by resources that offer services online or over the phone.

___________

## Features

Create an account feature which allows users to:
- Find resources through selecting preferences/specifications.
- Filter through resources based on age and location.
- Allows users to save(+add and delete) resources from app.
- Hotlines/chat links.

## Technical Challenges

- The majority of challenges I had with this project were with backend technologies. Some specific challenges included:


## What I have learned:

- I have learned a lot throughout this project. One of the biggest lessons was how to prioritize my time and stay focused on the MVP (and not get hung up on minor details). Through this process I also learned how necessary (and important!) it is to ask for help when unsure of things. And how to google better (sort of).

## Future Implementation: 

While this app can find appropriate resources based on selections the user makes, I also would like to further filter based on age and location. 
In addition to filtering through resources to find the best fit, ideally the user would also be able to save, contact, schedule appointments, and correspond with their saved resources all within the app. I would also love to do more with the design.
